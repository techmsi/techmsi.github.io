      Privacy Policy
      <small>for Alexa Skills</small>
    </h1>
    <p>
      This privacy policy describes how the developer (Sophie Idromenos) (“the
      creator”) protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data. Before
      using any of the Alexa Skills (“the skills”), please read this agreement
      and the
      <a href="/alexa-skills/terms-of-use.html">Alexa Skills Terms of Use</a> as
      well as the
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740"
        >Alexa Terms of Use</a
      >
      and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacy">Privacy Policies</a> by
      the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes
      third party services (like our skills) and other related Software.
    </p>
    <p>If you use one of the skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.</p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      When you use the skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is
      sent to Amazon and us where we use it to understand what the skill should
      do for you. This is absolutely necessary for the service to give you an
      appropriate answer.
    </p>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>We never collect or share personal data with the skills.</p>
    <p>
      To improve our services we analyze automatically how often utterances are
      spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the
      Amazon Developer Portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some of the skills it is necessary to save data for you in our
      databases. This data is never connected to your name or any other personal
      information. Otherwise, this service could not be provided to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      The skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further,
      this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on
      the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store.
      Your continued use of the skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the
      skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
